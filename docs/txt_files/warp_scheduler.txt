Warp Scheduler Functions and Features
The Warp Scheduler is the orchestrator of warp execution, managing the flow of data and instructions from the program into the execution units. Its role is to keep the pipeline full and handle complex inter-instruction and inter-warp dependencies.

Core Features:

1. Warp State Management:
Maintains per-warp state: Active, Runnable (ready to issue), Stalled (waiting for resources, data, or sync), Sleeping (waiting for external event), Completed.
Program Counter (PC) Tracking: Independent PC for each active warp.
Active Mask Management: Tracks which threads within a warp are active for execution, crucial for SIMT execution.
Predicate Register Management: Manages and provides access to per-warp predicate registers (P0-P127) for conditional execution.
Register File Allocation: Manages the portion of the SM's Register File allocated to each active warp.

2. Instruction Fetch and Buffering:
Fetches instructions from the Instruction Cache/Memory based on the scheduled warp's PC.
Maintains per-warp Instruction Buffers/Queues to pre-fetch instructions, reducing front-end stalls.

3. Warp Prioritization and Selection:
Implements sophisticated scheduling policies (e.g., Weighted Round-Robin, Scoreboard-driven, Oldest-first, or more adaptive policies) to select the next Runnable warp to issue instructions from.
Aims to prioritize warps that can keep functional units busy, considering dependencies and available resources.

4. High-Level Hazard Detection:

Structural Hazards: Checks for conflicts on shared functional units (e.g., too many warps trying to use the Memory Unit simultaneously).
Data Hazards (RAW/WAW/WAR): High-level tracking of inter-instruction data dependencies within a warp using a scoreboard or similar mechanism to stall warps until required data is available.
Control Hazards: Manages pipeline flushing/stalling for branches, jumps, and calls. May integrate with a high-level Branch Predictor.

5. Synchronization Management:
Handles __syncthreads() barriers: Ensures all threads within a thread block reach a synchronization point before any can proceed.
Manages other memory fences and synchronization primitives required by the programming model.

6. Concurrent Instruction Issuing (Dual Issue / Multi-Issue):
Ability to issue multiple independent instructions from the same warp in a single clock cycle. This is a hallmark of Turing and later architectures (e.g., one integer instruction and one floating-point instruction simultaneously).
Requires multiple instruction queues/ports and parallel decode logic to check for independent instructions.

7. Multi-Queue Scheduling / Dispatch Grouping:
May maintain separate instruction queues or "dispatch groups" per warp for different types of instructions (e.g., one queue for Integer/FP ALU, one for Memory, one for Tensor Cores). This enables faster dispatch if specific unit types are free.

8. Dynamic Scheduling / Out-of-Order Capabilities (within limits):
While not fully out-of-order like a CPU, the scheduler might reorder independent instructions within a warp if the target functional unit is available.
Uses more sophisticated dependency tracking (e.g., dependency graphs or reservation stations) to identify instruction-level parallelism.

9. Fine-Grained Divergence Management:
Beyond simple active mask updates, sophisticated mechanisms to manage divergent threads within a warp, potentially allowing partially active warps to proceed more efficiently or enabling re-convergence.
Support for "Independent Thread Scheduling" where each thread can have its own PC, but the scheduler still dispatches in warp-granular units.

10. Power and Thermal Management Integration:
Receives feedback on SM temperature and power consumption.
Dynamically adjusts scheduling policies or frequency to prevent overheating or stay within power limits.
May deprioritize certain warps or reduce clock frequency.

11. Workload-Aware Scheduling:
May use historical performance data or hints from the compiler/driver to adapt scheduling policies for different kernel types (e.g., compute-bound vs. memory-bound).
