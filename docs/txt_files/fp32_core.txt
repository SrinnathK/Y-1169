We will leverage SystemVerilog's built int floating-point operators for behavioural modeling.
On synthesis, these operators map to pre-defined floating-point IP blocks which are usually IEEE 754 compliant.

0xA0: FADD (Floating-Point Addition)
0xA1: FSUB (Floating-Point Subtraction)
0xA2: FMUL (Floating-Point Multiplication)
0xA3: FDIV (Floating-Point Division)
0xA4: FNEG (Floating-Point Negation)
0xA5: FABS (Floating-Point Absolute Value)
0xA6: FSQRT (Floating-Point Square Root)
0xA7: FRCP (Floating-Point Reciprocal: 1.0 / X)
0xA8: FRSQRT (Floating-Point Reciprocal Square Root: 1.0 / sqrt(X))
0xA9: FMA (Fused Multiply-Add: (A * B) + C)
0xAA: FMIN (Floating-Point Minimum)
0xAB: FMAX (Floating-Point Maximum)
0xAC: FTOI (Floating-Point to Signed Integer Conversion)
0xAD: ITOF (Signed Integer to Floating-Point Conversion)
0xAE: FEQ (Floating-Point Equal Comparison)
0xAF: FNE (Floating-Point Not Equal Comparison)
0xB0: FLT (Floating-Point Less Than Comparison)
0xB1: FLE (Floating-Point Less Than or Equal Comparison)
0xB2: FGT (Floating-Point Greater Than Comparison)
0xB3: FGE (Floating-Point Greater Than or Equal Comparison)
0xB4 - 0xBF: Reserved for future floating-point extensions (e.g., double-precision, transcendentals, more complex conversions, rounding modes).
