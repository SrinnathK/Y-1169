# Y-1169
Y-1169 is a full-scale, Turing-inspired GPU microarchitecture, implemented entirely in SystemVerilog. It models a realistic, synthesizable hardware accelerator with support for SIMD warp-level execution, tensor core acceleration, and a multi-level cache hierarchy, targeting AI/ML workloads and high-performance computing.
